    <h2>Cats</h2>
    <p>Cats are my <strong>#1</strong> favorite animal. They are <em>so</em> cute and do the funniest things. I like them so much that I even own two of them as pets. I like all breeds of cats. The name of my first cat is Skyy and she is all black. My second cat is Stella and she is orange with spots. They are sisters and their mom's name is Margarita. I have owned both dogs and cats before and can confidently say I am a cat person. </p>
