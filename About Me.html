    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>I was born in 2004 in Springfield, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri" target="_blank">Missouri</a>. I grew up as an only child and traveled a lot. Before I knew it I <strong>graduated highschool</strong> in 2022 and was on my way to attend Mizzou.</p>

    <h2>Places I've been</h2>
    <p>I've been <em>all over the world</em> because my grandparents valued traveling with the family. Every year they would take us all somewhere new. That combined with playing travel sports made for a lot of moving around. Below I've listed my top three favorite locations.</p>
