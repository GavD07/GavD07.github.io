    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>I love listening to music and I enjoy every genre. However, my favorite genre is jazz. My favorite jazz musicians inclue <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erroll_Garner/">Erroll Garner</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Mulligan">Gerry Mulligan</a>. When I'm not listening to their albums or live recordings I enjoy playing jazz piano and clarinet. <em>Although I don't play as much as I used to</em> it is still a lot of fun for me and I play when I have the time. </p>

    <h2>Tennis</h2>
    <p>I started playing tennis my freshman year of high school. When I started out I didn't even make varsity but by the end of my senior year I made it all the way to the #1 seed on my team. I even made it to sectionals in doubles. I only play tennis for fun now though.</p>

    <h2>Mushrooms</h2>
    <p> In my freetime I love growing gourmet mushrooms. I love the way they taste and I love the process of growing them. I even did a research project about how certain mushrooms can decompose oils and plastics in an ecologically friendly way.<img src="https://www.thespruceeats.com/thmb/MstJFAsdFVWsIjGxQFPACJp-0vs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/what-are-oyster-mushrooms-4172003_Hero_01-a99567710c6546c6848ab70025211c8a.jpg" width= 400></img>
