    <h2>Purple</h2>
    <p>I like all the colors but purple is different. It is scarcely found naturally but when it is it outshines the colors that surround it. I like all shades of purple, from the dark shade of mauveine to the light shade of lavender. Purple matches so well with colors like orange, yellow, blue, and black (the list could go on). Due to it's natural beauty and versatility in matching other colors purple has been my favorite color for the longest time.</p>

    <h2>Things That are Purple</h2>
    <p>Grapes are one of the most commonly recognized purple items that exist. Not only that but they're super tasty. Some may even speculate that the purple grapes taste better than the green grapes. When I go to the store to buy grapes I always try to buy the purple ones because I know I will enjoy them more than the alternatives. The amethyst gemstone is also purple. It also happens to be my birthstone. Not only is it pretty but it also symbolizes the purity of the spirit. </p>
